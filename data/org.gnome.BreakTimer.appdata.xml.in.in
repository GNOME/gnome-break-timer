  <summary>Remember to take regular breaks from using the computer</summary>
  <description>
    <p>Break Timer keeps track of how much you are using the computer, and it reminds you to take regular breaks. It is designed to encourage healthy behaviour, with a mix of short breaks for your eyes and wrists, as well as longer breaks to keep your body moving and your mind on task.</p>
    <p>Break Timer is simple to set up, so you can pick a break schedule that works for you and it will carry on working in the background.</p>
