Break Timer
===========

A break timer application for GNOME.

This helps you to schedule regular breaks. It will remind you to take them
based on how much you are using the computer. It tries hard to be simple but
helpful, using notifications to gently indicate when a break has arrived while
keeping out of the way for activities like games and videos.
